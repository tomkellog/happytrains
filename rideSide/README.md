This is how our GraphQL data model looks like:

  description: String!
  imageUrl: String!
}
```

### 2. Configure app data endpoint

Open `src/app/client.ts` and paste your endpoint to the following line:

```js
const networkInterface = createNetworkInterface('https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/__PROJECT_ID__')
```


### 3. Run the example

You're done configuring the example application. Please run the following command and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. Have fun exploring! 🎉

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
